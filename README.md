# Welcome to Quizzup ðŸŽ®

Quizzup is a React Native Expo quiz app where users can create and take quizzes. This project was created with create-expo-app.

## Features

- Create custom quizzes
- Answer quiz questions from a variety of categories
- Interactive UI built using React Native and Expo
- Quiz questions powered by [Open Trivia Database (OTDB)](https://opentdb.com/) (special thanks to OTDB for their API and questions!)

## Get started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the app:

```bash
npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- Development build
- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Expo Go, a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the app directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).

## Reset the project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the app-example directory and create a blank app directory where you can start developing.
